# servlet 是什么
J2EE标准的一部分
定义了Java如何处理Web请求的标准，是接口。

> Servlet是Server+Applet的缩写，表示一个服务器应用

更准确的定义
> Defines methods that all servlets must implement.
A servlet is a small Java program that runs within a Web server. Servlets receive and respond to requests from Web clients, usually across HTTP, the HyperText Transfer Protocol.
To implement this interface, you can write a generic servlet that extends javax.servlet.GenericServlet or an HTTP servlet that extends javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.
This interface defines methods to initialize a servlet, to service requests, and to remove a servlet from the server. These are known as life-cycle methods and are called in the following sequence:
The servlet is constructed, then initialized with the init method.
Any calls from clients to the service method are handled.
The servlet is taken out of service, then destroyed with the destroy method, then garbage collected and finalized.
In addition to the life-cycle methods, this interface provides the getServletConfig method, which the servlet can use to get any startup information, and the getServletInfo method, which allows the servlet to return basic information about itself, such as author, version, and copyright.
